# üõ©Ô∏è Ultralight Drone Hardware Lab ‚Äî Public Showcase

This repository documents an experimental journey into the design and prototyping of an **ultra-lightweight drone built from scratch**, combining **custom hardware** with **open-source flight control software**.  
The aim is to explore the feasibility of **low-cost UAV prototyping** while learning about flight dynamics, embedded control, and lightweight construction.

---

## ‚ú® Project Highlights
- **Hardware from scratch**: custom frame, Arduino-based controller, and lightweight motor/propeller setup  
- **Ultra-low-cost design**: components inspired by <$15 build challenges  
- **Rapid prototyping**: open to iterations, improvements, and continuous redesign  
- **Control logic**: based on open-source Arduino flight libraries (with manual tuning and testing)  
- **Learning focus**: flight stabilization, modular architecture, hardware/software co-design  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Libraries
The project leverages community-driven tools and Arduino libraries as described in reference projects:
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)  
- Basic motor driver libraries (ESC control)  
- Open-source sensor drivers (accelerometer/gyroscope modules, e.g. MPU6050)  
- PWM and PID control libraries for Arduino flight stabilization

## üî© Hardware Components (prototype stage)
Inspired by community projects and subject to ongoing experimentation:
- **Controller**: Arduino Nano board  
- **Motors**: Coreless brushed motors (micro quadcopter class)  
- **ESC / Motor drivers**: both off-the-shelf low-cost modules and custom-built power stage  
- **Propellers**: lightweight plastic props  
- **Frame**: DIY custom frame (ultra-light materials, handmade prototyping)  
- **Battery**: LiPo micro packs  

*(The actual build may evolve with multiple iterations and hardware alternatives.)*
